> B-Spline Trajectory Tracking with Simulated UAV Dynamics and Modular Controller Framework

This repository simulates trajectory tracking for quadrotor-like aerial vehicles using B-spline path interpolation and a simplified dynamic model inspired by PX4 flight stack architecture. It provides a mock drone simulator, a modular control framework (supporting PID and placeholder MPC), and real-time visualization.

It is ideal for prototyping controller logic, debugging trajectory-following algorithms, or serving as an educational/research scaffold for aerial motion planning.

## 🔧 System Components

- 🛩️ **`drone.py`**: 6-DOF kinematic simulator for a UAV model
- 🎯 **`trajectory.py`**: B-spline interpolation and trajectory generator
- 🎮 **`controller.py`**: Modular control interface with mock PID and MPC stubs
- 📊 **`visualization/plot_trajectory.py`**: 2D/3D trajectory rendering using matplotlib
- 🔁 Designed for future integration with planning and mapping stacks

## ✨ Features

- Plug-and-play controller interface (PID / initial MPC attempts)
- Configurable drone dynamics and state update loop
- Realistic simulation of tracking deviation and control response
- Visualization of ground truth vs predicted trajectory

## 🔬 Applications

- Research on trajectory tracking and model-based control for UAVs
- Educational demos of control loop structure for drones
- Benchmarking control response under trajectory perturbations
